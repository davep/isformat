# IsFormat

This repository contains the source for a function I wrote for CA-Clipper
way back in the day. It quickly checks the content of a string against a
format. The format itself is very basic when compared with CA-Clipper's
format abilities but the idea behind this code is to be quick and dirty.

A function like this might be handy for checking things like postal codes.
